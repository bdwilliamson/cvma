> Machine learning-based summary of association with multivariate outcomes

__Authors:__ [David Benkeser](https://www.benkeserstatistics.com/) and Ivana Malenica

## Introduction

This package provides a method for summarizing the strength of association between a set of variables and a multivariate outcome. In particular, cross-validation is combined with stacked regression (aka super learning) to estimate the convex combination of a multivariate outcome that maximizes cross-validated R-squared of a super learner-based prediction. The method is particularly well suited for situations with high-dimensional covariates and/or complex relationships between covariates and outcomes. 

## Installation

You can install a stable release of `cvma` from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("benkeser/cvma")
```

In the future, the package will be available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cvma")
```
