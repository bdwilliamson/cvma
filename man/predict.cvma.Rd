\title{Get predictions on cvma object}
\usage{
\method{predict}{cvma}(object, newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{cvma}}

\item{newdata}{A \code{data.frame} of predictors on which to obtain predictions}

\item{...}{Other options (not currently used)}
}
\value{
A list of predictions with named entries \code{y_weight} and \code{object$y_names}.
The former contains predictions of the weighted outcome, while the latter contains predictions of
the respective univariate outcome. Each entry in the outputted list is itself a list with two entries. 
The first is a vector of super learner predictions for the particular outcome, while the second
is a matrix with columns corresponding the the various learners predictions of the particular outcome.
