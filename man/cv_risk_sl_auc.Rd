\title{Cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
for predictions based on super learner}
\usage{
cv_risk_sl_auc(input, sl_control)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{List where each entry corresponds to a validation fold. Each entry is a list
with entries: Y (univariate outcome for this validation fold), pred (matrix of predictions
from \code{learner} and columns correspond to different \code{learner}).}

\item{sl_control}{List of super learner control options.}
}
\description{
In general, the function passed to \code{sl_control$cv_risk} should expect a list
of outcomes and predictions in validation folds. The function should return a 
list with names cv_measure, ci_low, ci_high, and p_value. The output of this function 
is returned irrespective of the names of the list; however, the names are 
necessary for \code{print} methods to work properly.
}
\details{
In this case, the confidence intervals are computed using the \code{cvAUC::cvAUC.ci}
function from the \code{cvAUC} package. The p-value
is for the one-sided hypothesis test that cross-validated AUC equals 0.5 against
the alternative that it is greater than 0.5.

\examples{
# simulate data with proper format
input <- list(list(valid_folds=1, Y = rbinom(50,1,0.5), pred = rbinom(50,1,0.5)),
              list(valid_folds=2, Y = rbinom(50,1,0.5), pred = rbinom(50,1,0.5))) 
     
# alpha value                        
sl_control= list(alpha= 0.05)    

# get risk 
cv_risk <- cv_risk_sl_r2(input, sl_control)   
}
