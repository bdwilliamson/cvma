\title{Cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
for computing composite outcome weights}
\usage{
optim_risk_y_auc(y_weight, input, y_weight_control)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_weight}{A numeric vector of weights corresponding to each
outcome. Typically, this is what is maximized over in \code{y_weight_control$weight_fn}.}

\item{input}{A list with named entries Y (matrix of outcomes for this validation fold) and 
pred (matrix of super learner predictions for each outcomes with columns corresponding to 
different outcomes).}

\item{y_weight_control}{Composite outcome weight control options.}
}
\value{
Numeric value of cross-validated AUC.
}
\description{
In general, the function passed to \code{y_weight_control$optim_risk} should expect a named list
of outcomes (Y) and predictions (pred) in validation folds and should return a criteria by
which outcome weights may be optimized. The weights are input to the function via
\code{y_weight} and are optimized in the \code{y_weight_control$weight_fn}. See
Examples section below for an example of the format of the \code{input} list used
for \code{y_weight_control$optim_risk} functions.
}
\examples{

#Simulate data with proper format:
input <- list(list(Y = cbind(rbinom(50,1,0.5), rbinom(50,1,0.5), rbinom(50,1,0.5)), 
pred = cbind(runif(50,0,1), runif(50,0,1), runif(50,0,1))))

#Linear combination of outcomes:
y_weight_control <- list(ensemble_fn = "ensemble_linear")

#Example weights:
y_weight<-c(0,1,0)

#Get risk:
risk <- optim_risk_y_auc(y_weight, input, y_weight_control)
}
