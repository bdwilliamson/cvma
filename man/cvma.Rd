\usage{
cvma(Y, X, V = 5, learners, sl_control = list(ensemble_fn =
  "ensemble_linear", optim_risk_fn = "optim_risk_sl_se", weight_fn =
  "weight_sl_convex", cv_risk_fn = "cv_risk_sl_r2", family = gaussian(), alpha =
  0.05), y_weight_control = list(ensemble_fn = "ensemble_linear", weight_fn =
  "weight_y_convex", optim_risk_fn = "optim_risk_y_r2", cv_risk_fn =
  "cv_risk_y_r2", alpha = 0.05), return_outer_weight = TRUE,
  return_outer_sl = TRUE, return_all_y = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A matrix or data.frame of outcomes}

\item{X}{A matrix or data.frame of predictors}

\item{V}{Number of outer folds of cross-validation (nested cross-validation
uses V-1 and V-2 folds), so must be at least four.}

\item{learners}{Super learner wrappers. See \code{SuperLearner::listWrappers}.}

\item{sl_control}{A list with named entries ensemble.fn, optim_risk_fn, weight_fn,
cv_risk_fn, family. Available functions can be viewed with \code{sl_control_options()}. See
\code{?sl_control_options} for more on how users may supply their own functions.}

\item{y_weight_control}{A list with named entries ensemble.fn, optim_risk_fn, weight_fn,
cv_risk_fn. Available functions can be viewed with \code{y_weight_control_options()}. See
\code{?y_weight_control_options} for more on how users may supply their own functions.}

\item{return_outer_weight}{Whether to return estimate of outcome
weights the outer most cross-validation layer (i.e, based on V - 1 cross-validated 
super learner risks).}

\item{return_outer_sl}{Whether to return the super learner for the outer most cross-validation
layer (i.e., V-fold super learner).}

\item{return_all_y}{Whether to return cross-validated performance measures for each
column of \code{Y}.}

\item{scale}{Standardize each outcome to be mean zero with standard deviation 1.}
}
\value{
If \code{return_outer_sl} is TRUE, it will return for each outcome Super Learner fit weights 
and associated risk for each learner. In addition, it will return the fit for all learners based on 
all folds. If \code{return_outer_weight} is TRUE, it will return the weights for each outcome
obtained using V-1 cross-validation. If \code{return_all_y} is TRUE, it will return for each 
outcome cross-validated measure (nonparametric R-squared or AUC), confidence interval and associated
p-value.
