#' Cross-validated maximal association measures
#' 
#' A flexible interface for computing cross-validation-based measures of maximal association.
#' In an outer layer of V-fold cross validation, training samples are used to train a prediction 
#' algorithm for each outcome. Multiple algorithms may be ensembled using stacking (also known as 
#' super learning) based on V-2 fold cross-validation. An inner layer of V-1 cross validation is used 
#' to determine a user-specified combination of outcomes that maximizes a user-specified prediction 
#' criteria. The outer layer
#' validation sample is used to compute a user-specified cross-validated measure of performance of
#' the prediction algorithm for predicting the combined outcome that was computed in the training 
#' sample. Several common choices for outcome combinations (convex combination of
#' outcomes and single outcome that is most associated) and prediction criteria (nonparametric R^2,
#' negative log-likelihood, and area under ROC curve) are included; however, users may specify
#' their own criteria as well. The function returns the cross-validated summary measure for the
#' maximally combined outcome and, if desired, the cross-validated summary measure for each 
#' outcome.  
#' 
#' TO DO: Figure out how future works (e.g., can plan() be specified internally
#' or externally?)
#' 
#' @param Y A matrix or data.frame of outcomes
#' @param X A matrix or data.frame of predictors
#' @param V Number of outer folds of cross-validation (nested cross-validation
#' uses V-1 and V-2 folds), so must be at least four. 
#' @param learners Super learner wrappers. See \code{SuperLearner::listWrappers}.
#' @param sl_control A list with named entries ensemble.fn, optim_risk_fn, weight_fn,
#' cv_risk_fn, family. Available functions can be viewed with \code{sl_control_options()}. See
#' \code{?sl_control_options} for more on how users may supply their own functions.  
#' @param y_weight_control A list with named entries ensemble.fn, optim_risk_fn, weight_fn,
#' cv_risk_fn. Available functions can be viewed with \code{y_weight_control_options()}. See
#' \code{?y_weight_control_options} for more on how users may supply their own functions.  
#' @param return_outer_weight Whether to return estimate of outcome
#' weights the outer most cross-validation layer (i.e, based on V - 1 cross-validated 
#' super learner risks).
#' @param return_outer_sl Whether to return the super learner for the outer most cross-validation
#' layer (i.e., V-fold super learner).
#' @param return_all_y Whether to return cross-validated performance measures for each
#' column of \code{Y}. 
#' @param scale Standardize each outcome to be mean zero with standard deviation 1.
#' 
#' @return If \code{return_outer_sl} is TRUE, it will return for each outcome Super Learner fit weights 
#' and associated risk for each learner. In addition, it will return the fit for all learners based on 
#' all folds. If \code{return_outer_weight} is TRUE, it will return the weights for each outcome
#' obtained using V-1 cross-validation. If \code{return_all_y} is TRUE, it will return for each 
#' outcome cross-validated measure (nonparametric R-squared or AUC), confidence interval and associated
#' p-value.
