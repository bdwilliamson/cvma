Description: Estimates of association of a set of covariates with a multivariate outcome.
    Nested cross-validation is used to fit super learners for each component of the outcome, and to determine a composite outcomes that maximizes the fit of the super learner. Finally, an outer layer of cross-validation is used to accurately assess an association of the super learner with the optimized composite outcome.
