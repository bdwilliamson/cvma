> Machine learning-based summary of association with multivariate outcomes

**Authors:** [David Benkeser](https://www.benkeserstatistics.com/) and [Ivana Malenica](https://github.com/podTockom)

Introduction
------------

This package provides a method for summarizing the strength of association between a set of variables and a multivariate outcome. In particular, cross-validation is combined with stacked regression (aka super learning) to estimate the convex combination of a multivariate outcome that maximizes cross-validated R-squared of a super learner-based prediction. The method is particularly well suited for situations with high-dimensional covariates and/or complex relationships between covariates and outcomes.

Installation
------------

You can install a stable release of `cvma` from GitHub via [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("benkeser/cvma")
```

In the future, the package will be available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) via

``` r
install.packages("cvma")
```

Issues
------

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please [file an issue](https://github.com/benkeser/cvma/issues).

Example
-------

This minimal example shows how to use `cvma` with very simple, simulated data set. For more examples and detailed explanations, we refer the user to the vignette. To start with, we use the nonparametric R^2 to evaluate the strength of association between a set of variables and a multivariate outcome:

``` r
suppressMessages(library(cvma))
set.seed(1234)

#Simulate data:
X <- data.frame(x1=runif(n=100,0,5), x2=runif(n=100,0,5))
Y1 <- rnorm(100, X$x1 + X$x2, 1)
Y2 <- rnorm(100, X$x1 + X$x2, 3)
Y <- data.frame(Y1 = Y1, Y2 = Y2)

#cvma with nonparametric R^2:
fit <- cvma(Y = Y, X = X, V = 10, 
                learners = c("SL.glm","SL.mean"))
fit
#>   cv_measure    ci_low   ci_high      p_value
#> 1  0.7648338 0.6616586 0.8365464 3.120828e-15
```

The following example evaluates the strength of association using AUC:

``` r

#Simulate data:
X <- data.frame(x1=runif(n=100,0,5), x2=runif(n=100,0,5))
Y1 <- rbinom(100, 1, plogis(-2 + 0.1*X$x1 + 0.2*X$x2))
Y2 <- rbinom(100, 1, plogis(-2 + 0.1*X$x1))
Y <- data.frame(Y1 = Y1, Y2 = Y2)

#cvma with AUC:
fit <- cvma(Y = Y, X = X, V = 5, 
                learners = c("SL.glm","SL.mean"),
                sl_control = list(ensemble_fn = "ensemble_linear",
                                   optim_risk_fn = "optim_risk_sl_nloglik",
                                   weight_fn = "weight_sl_convex",
                                   cv_risk_fn = "cv_risk_sl_auc",
                                   family = binomial(),
                                   alpha = 0.05),
                y_weight_control = list(ensemble_fn = "ensemble_linear",
                                  weight_fn = "weight_y_01",
                                  optim_risk_fn = "optim_risk_y_auc",
                                  cv_risk_fn = "cv_risk_y_auc",
                                  alpha = 0.05))
fit
#>   cv_measure    ci_low   ci_high   p_value
#> 1  0.3379673 0.1823169 0.4936178 0.9793412
```

Variable importance
-------------------

The cross-validated performance of two fits can be compared using the `compare_cvma` function. This can be used to define a variable importance measure for a set of variables.

``` r

#Simulate data:
X <- data.frame(x1=runif(n=100,0,5), x2=runif(n=100,0,5))
Y1 <- rnorm(100, X$x1 + X$x2, 1)
Y2 <- rnorm(100, X$x1 + X$x2, 3)
Y <- data.frame(Y1 = Y1, Y2 = Y2)

# fit data with full X
fit1 <- cvma(Y = Y, X = X, V = 10, 
                learners = c("SL.glm","SL.mean"))
# fit data with only x1
fit2 <- cvma(Y = Y, X = X[, -2, drop = FALSE], V = 10, 
                learners = c("SL.glm","SL.mean"))
# difference in cross-validated R^2 for the two fits
compare_cvma(fit1, fit2)
#> $contrast
#> [1] 0.4587962
#> 
#> $ci_low
#> [1] 0.3195792
#> 
#> $ci_high
#> [1] 0.5980131
#> 
#> $p_value
#>              [,1]
#> [1,] 1.052884e-10
```
